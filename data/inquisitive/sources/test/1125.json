But despite the declaration, disillusionment with the Israel-PLO agreement runs deep, and the leaders' ability to stem murderous attacks by Islamic militants was uncertain at best."}, {"text": "Rabin and Arafat, the key players, are facing dwindling popularity, and success of the agreement is crucial to their political careers. The Israeli-PLO talks were halted after a Jan. 22 suicide bombing that killed 21 Israelis."}, {"text": "The four also agreed to convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of Israel, Jordan and Egypt and a Palestinian representative in Washington with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Feb. 12."}, {"text": "In Washington, Christopher said the summit showed that the four 'are standing together in the pursuit of peace and they are also standing firmly together against those who would try to stop the march towards peace.'"}, {"text": "Thursday's meeting got under way after sundown at the Ittahadiya presidential palace with a meal to break the daylong fast Muslims observe during the holy month of Ramadan."}, {"text": "The three visiting leaders met with Mubarak separately before the summit, but no one commented on the meetings."}, {"text": "Before leaving Jerusalem, Rabin made it clear that an end to attacks on Israelis was the key to expanding autonomy in the West Bank and holding Palestinian elections, both elements of the Israeli-PLO accord signed in September 1993."}, {"text": "Arafat's government must 'make sure the territory they rule -- Gaza and Jericho -- is not used as shelter, or a place to prepare, incite and execute attacks,' Rabin told members of his Labor Party."}, {"text": "For their part, the Palestinians hoped Israel would reopen the Palestinian territories closed since a Jan. 22 boming, said Arafat adviser Nabil Abu Irdeineh."}, {"text": "The Palestinians want Israel to begin withdrawing Israeli troops from Palestinian towns in the West Bank to make way for elections and the release of Palestinian prisoners. They also demand a halt to the expansion of Jewish settlements on occupied land -- even as Israel is adding thousands of homes to the Jewish enclaves."}, {"text": "The summit marked an acceptance of Israel by Arab countries unimaginable just a few years ago.
